In this project, we will attempt to create a Cohort Analysis for customers based off a transnational data set which contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail.

Cohort Analysis is useful for identifying underlying trends, as well as finding out the top contributors to the revenue within the company
